/**
 * A Stryker checker that splits one mutation run into parallel shards.
 *
 * Mutant ids are sequential, so mutant N belongs to shard (N mod count) + 1:
 * neighbouring mutants, which tend to be covered by the same tests, land in
 * different shards and every shard gets a similar share of the work. Mutants
 * owned by another shard fail the check as a CompileError, which Stryker
 * neither tests nor counts in the score. merge-shards.mjs takes each mutant's
 * result from its owner and applies the break threshold to the whole report.
 *
 * Shards are selected with STRYKER_SHARD (1-based) and STRYKER_SHARD_COUNT;
 * see stryker.shard.config.mjs.
